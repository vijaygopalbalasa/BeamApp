================================================================================
PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS
================================================================================

TRANSFER SPEEDS:
  MTU 23 bytes:  ~400 bytes/second
  MTU 185 bytes: ~2 KB/second
  MTU 512 bytes: ~5 KB/second

TYPICAL TRANSFER TIMES:
  1 KB bundle:   0.2 - 2.5 seconds
  10 KB bundle:  2 - 25 seconds
  100 KB bundle: 20 - 240 seconds

DISCOVERY TIME:
  Typical: 2-5 seconds
  Maximum: 15 seconds (configurable)

BATTERY IMPACT:
  Advertising: 3-5% per hour
  Scanning:    5-8% per hour
  Transaction: <0.1% per payment

RANGE:
  Ideal:  30-50 meters
  Indoor: 10-20 meters
  Typical: 5-10 meters

================================================================================
PLATFORM SUPPORT
================================================================================

ANDROID:
  Minimum: Android 5.0 (API 21)
  Recommended: Android 8.0+ (API 26) for extended advertising
  Limitations: Some devices don't support peripheral mode

IOS:
  Minimum: iOS 10.0
  Recommended: iOS 10.0+ for 512-byte MTU
  Limitations: Background mode restrictions

BOTH:
  • Real devices required (emulators don't support peripheral mode)
  • Bluetooth 4.0+ hardware required
  • Bluetooth 4.2+ recommended for larger MTU

================================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

CRITICAL:
  1. iOS background mode restrictions
  2. Some Android devices lack peripheral support
  3. Emulators don't support BLE peripheral mode

MEDIUM:
  4. Maximum bundle size: 256 KB
  5. Transfer speed slower than WiFi/NFC
  6. Limited range (10-30 meters typical)
  7. Connection limit (~7-8 simultaneous)

LOW:
  8. MTU negotiation not guaranteed
  9. No BLE-level encryption (app-layer only)
  10. Advertisement data can be intercepted
  11. Platform-specific quirks

WORKAROUNDS PROVIDED FOR ALL LIMITATIONS
(See docs/BLE_KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md)

================================================================================
