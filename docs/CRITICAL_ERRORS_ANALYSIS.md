## CRITICAL ISSUE #1: ONLINE PAYMENT CREATES OFFLINE BUNDLE (WRONG BEHAVIOR)

### Observed Behavior:
When customer scans merchant QR while **BOTH devices are ONLINE**, the app:
1. ‚úÖ Detects network is online: `[CustomerScreen] Online - attempting immediate attestation...`
2. ‚úÖ Creates Play Integrity token successfully
3. ‚ùå **FAILS attestation with "Missing required fields"**
4. ‚ùå **Falls back to offline bundle creation** (WRONG!)
5. ‚ùå **Attempts BLE broadcast** (WRONG when online!)
6. ‚ùå Shows success message: `networkStatus: 'üåê Online - ready for settlement'` but payment is actually OFFLINE

### Log Evidence:
```
15:42:53 [CustomerScreen] Online - attempting immediate attestation...
15:42:56 ‚ùå '[VerifierService] Attestation request failed:', [Error: Missing required fields]
15:42:56 ‚ö†Ô∏è [CustomerScreen] Immediate attestation failed, will queue
15:42:58 [BLEDirect] Broadcasting bundle (WRONG - should settle on-chain!)
15:42:59 Bundle created with transaction state: ATTESTED
15:42:59 Final status: networkStatus: 'üåê Online - ready for settlement' (LIE!)
```

### Expected Behavior:
When ONLINE + valid attestation:
1. Create payment bundle
2. **IMMEDIATELY call `settlementService.settleOfflinePayment(bundle)`**
3. **Submit transaction to Solana blockchain**
4. **Transfer USDC from escrow to merchant on-chain**
5. **Show "‚úÖ Payment settled on Solana" message**
6. **NO BLE broadcast, NO offline bundle storage**

### Root Cause:
1. **Primary**: Attestation validation failing with "Missing required fields" prevents online settlement
2. **Secondary**: No fallback to direct on-chain settlement when attestation fails but network is available
3. **Tertiary**: Code incorrectly treats attestation failure as "must go offline"

### Files to Fix:
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/screens/CustomerScreen.tsx` (lines ~596-728)
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/services/AttestationIntegrationService.ts`
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/services/VerifierService.ts`

## CRITICAL ISSUE #2: ATTESTATION "Missing required fields" ERROR

### Frequency: **EVERY SINGLE ATTESTATION REQUEST FAILS**

### Log Evidence (Multiple Occurrences):
```
15:42:56 ‚ùå [VerifierService] Attestation request failed: [Error: Missing required fields]
15:42:57 ‚ùå [AttestationIntegration] Failed to create attestation: [Error: Missing required fields]
15:42:59 ‚ùå [AttestationQueue] Attestation failed: beam_1761731807241_dxdm6bryn
15:43:00 ‚ùå [AttestationQueue] Attestation failed: beam_1761732773588_pmov8vvuq

15:47:19 ‚ùå [VerifierService] Attestation request failed: [Error: Missing required fields]
15:47:20 ‚ùå [AttestationIntegration] Failed to create attestation: [Error: Missing required fields]
15:47:20 ‚ùå [AttestationQueue] Attestation failed: beam_1761731807241_dxdm6bryn
```

### What Works:
- ‚úÖ Play Integrity token generated successfully
- ‚úÖ Device info collected (model: RMX3771, securityLevel: STRONGBOX)
- ‚úÖ Bundle hash computed
- ‚úÖ Nonce generated
- ‚úÖ Token sent to verifier service: `https://beam-verifier.vercel.app`

### What Fails:
- ‚ùå Verifier responds with "Missing required fields"
- ‚ùå NO attestation envelope returned
- ‚ùå Bundle stuck in "pending" state forever

### Suspected Missing Fields:
Based on code analysis, the verifier expects:
```typescript
{
  bundleId: string,
  deviceToken: string,        // Play Integrity JWT
  bundleHash: string,
  timestamp: number,
  deviceInfo: {
    model: string,
    osVersion: string,
    securityLevel: string
  },
  // POSSIBLY MISSING:
  payer?: string,             // Wallet public key
  merchant?: string,          // Merchant public key
  amount?: number,            // Payment amount
  nonce?: number              // Bundle nonce
}
```

### Files to Fix:
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/services/AttestationIntegrationService.ts` (lines 29-177)
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/services/VerifierService.ts`

## CRITICAL ISSUE #3: BLE NOT DETECTING PEERS

### Observed Behavior:
- ‚úÖ BLE service starts successfully
- ‚úÖ Broadcast attempts execute
- ‚ùå **ZERO peers detected EVERY TIME**: `peersReached: 0`
- ‚ùå No merchant device discovered
- ‚ùå No GATT connection established

### Log Evidence:
```
15:42:58 [CustomerScreen] üì° BLE Mesh Status BEFORE broadcast:
15:42:58   - Mesh Started: true
15:42:58   - Service UUID: 00006265-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
15:42:58   - Queue Length: 0
15:42:58 [BLEDirect] Broadcasting bundle: beam_1761732773588_pmov8vvuq
15:42:58 [BLEDirect] Broadcast result: { peersReached: 0, success: false }
15:42:59 [CustomerScreen] ‚ö†Ô∏è No peers reached - queueing for later delivery

15:43:07 [BLEDirect] Broadcasting bundle: beam_1761732773588_pmov8vvuq
15:43:07 [BLEDirect] Broadcast result: { peersReached: 0, success: false }

15:43:15 [BLEDirect] Broadcast result: { peersReached: 0, success: false }
15:43:31 [BLEDirect] Broadcast result: { peersReached: 0, success: false }
15:44:03 [BLEDirect] Broadcast result: { peersReached: 0, success: false }
```

### Possible Causes:
1. **Merchant device NOT advertising** as BLE peripheral
2. **Merchant app not in correct mode** (must be in "Merchant" role)
3. **BLE permissions not granted** on one or both devices
4. **Bluetooth disabled** on merchant device
5. **Service UUID mismatch** between customer (central) and merchant (peripheral)
6. **Android BLE stack issue** (devices out of range, interference)
7. **GATT server not started** on merchant device

### Files to Investigate:
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/services/BLEDirectService.ts` (832 lines)
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/services/BLEPeripheralService.ts`
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/android/app/src/main/java/com/beam/app/modules/BLEPeripheralModule.kt`
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/screens/MerchantScreen.tsx`

## CRITICAL ISSUE #4: SETTLEMENT FAILURES (LIKELY BLOCKED BY #1 AND #2)

### Observed:
- NO settlement attempts logged
- NO `settleOfflinePayment` calls
- NO Solana transaction submissions
- Bundles stuck in "pending" state forever

### Expected Settlement Flow:
1. Bundle created with attestation
2. Either party calls `settlementService.settleOfflinePayment(bundle)`
3. Submit to Solana program: `6BjVpGR1pGJ41xDJF4mMuvC7vymFBZ8QXxoRKFqsuDDi`
4. Program verifies attestation signatures
5. Transfer USDC from escrow to merchant
6. Bundle marked "settled"

### Current State:
- ‚ùå No settlement logs found
- ‚ùå Bundles never leave "pending" state
- ‚ùå No on-chain transactions
- ‚ùå Settlement button probably broken or hidden

### Files to Fix:
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/services/SettlementService.ts` (420 lines)
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/solana/BeamProgram.ts` (647 lines)
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`

## CRITICAL ISSUE #5: PLAY INTEGRITY AUTHORIZATION ERRORS

### Error Message:
```
15:42:56 ‚ùå [VerifierService] Attestation request failed:
[Error: Play Integrity validation failed: You are not authorized to decode the requested integrity token.]
```

### Cause:
The verifier service (`https://beam-verifier.vercel.app`) is **NOT AUTHORIZED** to decode Play Integrity tokens from this app.

### Root Cause:
1. **Google Cloud project mismatch**: App packageverifier project mismatch
2. **Missing API key**: `PLAY_INTEGRITY_API_KEY` not configured correctly
3. **Service account permissions**: Google service account lacks Play Integrity API access
4. **App not linked**: App's SHA-256 certificate fingerprint not added to Google Play Console

### Files to Fix:
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/verifier/.env` (backend environment variables)
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/verifier/src/attestation/google.ts` (213 lines)
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/verifier/src/env.ts`

### Required Actions:
1. Verify `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` in verifier matches app's Google Cloud project
2. Verify `PLAY_INTEGRITY_API_KEY` is valid and has correct permissions
3. Add app's SHA-256 fingerprint to Google Play Console
4. Grant service account Play Integrity API access in Google Cloud Console

---

## CRITICAL ISSUE #6: CODEX'S FIXES NOT APPLIED OR NOT WORKING

### What Codex Claimed to Fix:
1. ‚úÖ Added `normalizeBundles` helper (CustomerScreen.tsx:48)
2. ‚úÖ Improved online detection (CustomerScreen.tsx:588)
3. ‚úÖ Removed QR scan button from Offline Bundles (CustomerScreen.tsx:1319)
4. ‚úÖ Added robust fallbacks around Play Integrity (AttestationIntegrationService.ts:29-68)

### What's Actually Happening:
1. ‚ùå **Online detection improvement NOT fixing the problem** - still creating offline bundles when online
2. ‚ùå **Play Integrity fallbacks NOT working** - still getting "Missing required fields"
3. ‚ùì **QR scan button removal** - CAN'T VERIFY (need screenshot of offline bundles section)
4. ‚úÖ **normalizeBundles** - appears to be working (no duplicate key warnings after app restart)

### Conclusion:
**CODEX'S FIXES DID NOT SOLVE THE CORE PROBLEMS**
- Attestation still failing
- Online payments still going offline
- BLE still not connecting
- Settlement still not working

## ADDITIONAL ERRORS FOUND IN LOGS

### Error #7: Duplicate React Keys (Fixed by Codex)
```
15:42:22 Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `beam_1761733066783_l3y5tabyk`
15:42:23 Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `beam_1761732773588_pmov8vvuq`
```
**Status:** FIXED after app restart (normalizeBundles working)

### Error #8: Balance Loading Issues

15:47:11 [HomeScreen] Loading balances...
15:47:20 [ConnectionService] Fetching SOL and USDC balances in parallel...
15:47:20 [ConnectionService] Will try endpoints: [...]
```
**Status:** Balance loading appears to be working (no error in logs)

### Error #9: Escrow Balance Issues (From Previous Session)

## REQUIRED FIXES (IN PRIORITY ORDER)

### Priority 1: Fix Attestation "Missing required fields"
**File:** `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/services/AttestationIntegrationService.ts`

**Problem:** Verifier API call missing required fields in request body

**Solution:** Debug the exact payload being sent to verifier and compare with what verifier expects:
```typescript
// Add logging before verifier call:
console.log('[AttestationIntegration] REQUEST PAYLOAD:', JSON.stringify({
  bundleId,
  deviceToken,
  bundleHash,
  timestamp,
  deviceInfo,
  payer: bundle.payer,
  merchant: bundle.merchant,
  amount: bundle.amount,
  nonce: bundle.nonce
}));
```

### Priority 2: Fix Online Payment Flow
**File:** `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/screens/CustomerScreen.tsx`

**Problem:** When online + attestation succeeds, code should settle on-chain immediately, NOT create offline bundle

**Solution:** After attestation success, call:
```typescript
if (networkState.isConnected && attestation) {
  console.log('[CustomerScreen] üåê Settling on-chain immediately...');
  const result = await settlementService.settleOfflinePayment(bundle);
  if (result.success) {
    Alert.alert('‚úÖ Payment Settled', 'Transaction confirmed on Solana blockchain');
    return;
  }
}
// Only fall back to offline if settlement fails
```

### Priority 3: Fix BLE Peer Discovery
**Files:**
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/services/BLEDirectService.ts`
- `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/services/BLEPeripheralService.ts`

**Problem:** Customer (central) cannot discover Merchant (peripheral)

**Debug Steps:**
1. Verify merchant device is in "Merchant" mode (not Customer)
2. Check merchant logs for "BLE advertising started" message
3. Verify both devices have Bluetooth enabled and location permission granted
4. Check if GATT server is running on merchant device
5. Verify Service UUID matches: `00006265-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`

### Priority 4: Fix Play Integrity Authorization
**File:** `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/verifier/.env` (backend)

**Problem:** Verifier not authorized to decode Play Integrity tokens

**Solution:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate to Play Integrity API
3. Add service account with `playintegrity.verifications.read` permission
4. Download new credentials JSON
5. Update `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` in Vercel environment variables
6. Verify `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` matches app's project
7. Add app's SHA-256 certificate fingerprint to Play Console

### Priority 5: Enable Settlement UI
**File:** `/Users/vijaygopalb/Beam/mobile/beam-app/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`

**Problem:** No settlement attempts logged (settlement button might be hidden or disabled)

**Solution:** Ensure "Settle" button is visible for attested bundles and calls settlement service when pressed
